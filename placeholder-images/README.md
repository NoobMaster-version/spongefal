# Placeholder Images

This directory contains placeholder images for the project cards on the portfolio website. 

## Usage

Replace these images with actual project images when available. The images should be sized approximately 800x450 pixels for best display in the project cards.

## Default Placeholder

For any missing project images, you can use a default placeholder or take a screenshot of your actual project to better represent your work.

## Image Optimization

Remember to optimize your images before using them on your website to improve loading times.
